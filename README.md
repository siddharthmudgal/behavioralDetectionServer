# behavioralDetectionServer

Server built using MEAN stack, handlebars and fusion chart to show the comparison between two users way of walking.
This could be used as an additional layer of security.
Data is pushed to server to be processed.
Any two users can be compared to see the difference in the way they walk.
The server is capable enough to present this data in tables and charts for a neat comparison.
